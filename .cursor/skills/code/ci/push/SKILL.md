# CI — Push

The milestone workflow for pushing to the remote.

## Extends

Load `.cursor/skills/code/foundations/engineering/SKILL.md` first.

## Workflow

1. **Require explicit push consent.** Never push without it (see `.cursor/rules/behaviors/git-push-consent.mdc`). General work still needs an explicit "push" request. **Exception:** when running `code/review/pr-resolver`, approving the resolver plan (or an explicit "resolve comments" request) grants scoped commit+push consent for approved fix commits only — see pr-resolver `## Scoped consent`.
2. **Review at PR tier.** Run the reviewer (tier: pr). Require a clean verdict or an explicit skip.
3. **Check for an open PR** on the current branch:

```bash
command gh pr view --json number,url,state 2>/dev/null
```

`command gh` bypasses interactive shell aliases that break the CLI in agent shells — see `code/ci/pr/SKILL.md` `## GitHub CLI in agent shells`.

4. **If an open PR exists**, fetch its review threads (see `code/review/pr-resolver` graphql reference). If there are unresolved threads, stop and hand off to pr-resolver — do not push unrelated changes on top. **Exception:** pr-resolver may push after validation when executing an approved fix plan (its Step 6).
5. **If no open PR** (or no unresolved threads outside an active resolver fix push) and the local review passed, push.

```bash
git push        # only after explicit consent and a clean/again-skipped review
```

Never force-push to a shared branch without an explicit request, and warn before any force-push to a protected branch.
