# CI — Local Review Loop

Drives local changes to zero review findings before a commit, with the user in control. This is the local counterpart to the PR-resolver loop: same discipline, applied to the working tree instead of a remote PR.

## Extends

Load `.cursor/skills/code/foundations/engineering/SKILL.md` first.

## Loop

```
review (reviewer skill) → findings table
  → present triage: fix now | by design (keep) | defer
  → user approves which to fix
  → implement ONLY approved fixes (minimal, root-cause)
  → validate (lint/build from AGENT.md)
  → re-review
  → repeat until zero findings or user stops
→ offer to commit (never auto-commit)
```

## Rules

- **Not every finding must be fixed.** Some are intentional design — mark them "by design" and keep them, with a one-line rationale. The loop ends when the remaining findings are all accepted-by-design or fixed.
- **Fix only what the user approved.** Minimal, root-cause changes; no drive-by refactors.
- **No auto commit, no auto push.** When the loop ends clean, hand off to `code/ci/commit` only if the user asks to commit.
- **Validate every iteration.** Run the project's lint and build (see the repo `AGENT.md`) before re-reviewing.

## Triage table

```markdown
| # | Location | Severity | Finding | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | path:line | High | ... | Fix | ... |
| 2 | path:line | Low | ... | By design | intentional ... |
```

Wait for the user to confirm the decisions before implementing.
